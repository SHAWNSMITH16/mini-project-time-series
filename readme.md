**Project Title :**  Predicting weather in chicago for the next 10 years  


**Data Dictionary :**  

_Feature                     Definition_

avg_temp            - the average temperature by year from 1743-2013  

avg_uncert          - the average amount of chance the weather will be an outlier based on the average
 


**The Process / Project Plan :   
1. Select a city to predict weather temperatures on. I converted the temperatures from celcius to fahrenheit adn it gave me a wider range of numeric values. I resampled the data on a yearly basis from the monthly basis. 



**Steps To Reproduce :   
1. Assure the presence of a Python environment on your computer.  

2. Import :  
- Python libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scipy,   
- Pre-existing or self-created data 'acquire' and 'prepare' modules.  

3. Tidy the data.  

4. Explore using graphs, statistical evaluation, feature engineering, clustering and modelling.  

5. Evaluate, analyse and form conclusions and recommendations and indicate next steps.
